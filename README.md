# Attention-aware-CNN-Models-On-COVID-19-Detection
This project is about combining Bottleneck Attention Module(BAM) to Convolutional Neural Networks models and applying them to classify COVID-19 pneumonia from chest X-ray image dataset. The aim of this project is to compare and evaluate models performance based on their classification accuracy, precision, and recall.
